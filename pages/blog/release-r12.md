This is mostly a bugfix release:

 * Fixed a bug where `indent` behaved differently when passed as
   as an argument to JSHint.
 * Fixed a bug where `maxparams` check was failing on functions
   with no parameters.
 * New predefined globals for YUI.

Thanks to Dav Glass, Mariusz Nowak and Brad Harris.
