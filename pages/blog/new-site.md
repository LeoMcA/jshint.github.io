For the last couple of weeks I've been working on a new homepage for JSHint
and today I'm proud to announce the new [jshint.com](http://jshint.com/)!

![JSHint Website](/res/blog/new-site.png)

I decided to change the website to show the direction where I'm taking JSHint
and where I'd like to see other developer tools go in the near future.

If you go to the [front-page](http://jshint.com) right now, you'll notice
that it doesn't have a *Lint* button anymore. Once you start typing your
code, JSHint will always be working in the background, providing you with
valuable data about your code. This data consists of not only warnings but
also of different metrics such as the cyclomatic complexity. These metrics
help you step back and look at the overall health of your codebase.

I think that such instant feedback from the tools that monitor your code
can be quite useful and, now that the foundation is here, I plan to experiment
with these ideas using both [JSHint](http://github.com/jshint/jshint/) and
JSHint.com.

Stay tuned!
